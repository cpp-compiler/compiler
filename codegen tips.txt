first parse the AST for information about bindings (local variables vs functions)
then traverse the AST and allocate register locations for each sub expression (not necessarily hardware registers, you want to make an abstract register allocation routine)
then compile each sub expression into appropriate instructions
finish the function assembly by putting initialization code at the preamble and then cleanup code at the end.
output all of the compiled functions to a file
